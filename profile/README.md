## Our Mission

**Reclaim the Internet.**

DigitalPlat exists to push back against centralization, gatekeeping, and digital inequality.  
We believe the internet should remain open, interoperable, and owned by the people who use it.

Through open technology, nonprofit stewardship, and community-driven governance, we help ensure that anyone can build, publish, and participate online without barriers.
